webpack
babel-loader (lets webpack use babel)


------------

webpack --watch

compile es6 to es5: babel + babel-loader

------------

polyfills for the newest web standards:
    babel might do that, and it seems to have something to do with preset-env

what are other loaders like? why should I use/not use them?
    eslint seems like a good candidate

source map: devtools option, but I need to test it to be confident
what are flow types in es6?
using typescript or elm through webpack:
    once all the DOM crap is underneath pinout, can it be that other langs don't need much to interop?
